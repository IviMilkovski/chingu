        <h2 class="card-title">BTS</h2>
          </div>
        <p class="card-text p-4">Hi everyone! Today I want ta talk a bit about a group that got me more interested in Korean culture, BTS.
          So BTS are a 7 member kpop group that have been around for 7 years now. The members are Rm(the leader), Jin, Suga, Jhope, Jimin, V and Jungkook(the maknae - the youngest).7️⃣💜</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">I started listening to them around the beginning of 2016 and just fell in love with their music and their personalities. After that I started to listen to a couple of other groups and slowly started to learn a lot of new things about South Korea.
          Still BTS remain as my favourite group because I really appreciate their messages about loving yourself. This year BTS managed to even get #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart with both "Dynamite" and "Life goes on" and also managed to get a Grammy nomination. But just because they are very successful now doesn't mean they were always this successful. They started from a small company and when they debuted they didn't have a lot of fans but slowly after a couple of years they began to build a great fanbase and started to become more well known and I think the main reason is that they had a great connection with their fans, ARMY.💜</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">Something else that is also a big factor is that some of the members also help with the production and the writing for some of their songs. Also the rappers in the group all have phenomenal mixtapes which I could recommend to anyone and everyone. 🎹
          For the last couple of years BTS have been promoting Korean culture all around the world and managed to even increase tourism in Korea from that alone. 🇰🇷
          I can't even say everything that they have achieved in the last couple of years because it would turn into a book and not a post.
          All in all BTS are a once in a lifetime type of group that deserves all of the popularity that they are getting now.💜</p><p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">
          For last I just want to recommend some of my favourite songs of theirs:
          
          Agust D - Daechwita(a solo from my favourite member 💗)🔥
          BTS - Black Swan 🖤🦢
          BTS - Spring Day 🌱❄
          Rm - Seoul 🏙🌆
          BTS - Louder than Bombs 🔉🎤
          
          Just want to leave a short message to my fellow ARMY
          보라해 - Borahae - i purple you 💜</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Mugunghwa</h2>
          </div>
        <p class="card-text p-4">Hi everyone! Today I'll talk about Hibiscus Syriacus or Mugunghwa the national flower of South Korea. Mugunghwa(무궁화) is made up of the words 무궁 which means "immortal, eternal, everlasting" and 화 that means "flower" and it can also be translated as  “eternal blossom that never fades".🌺</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">This flower has been the symbol of Korean culture for centuries. In ancient records(around the Gojoseon era) it show that this flower was regarded as "a blossom from heaven". Later on some countries like China referred to Korea as "land of wise men where the mugunghwa blooms”. This flower really became an evan even bigger symbol in the 19th century when it was even included in the national anthem.
          There are different types of Mugunghwa and they are usually categorizes by colour. Some of the main types are Dansim, Baedal and Asadal. The one that was chosen as the national flower of Korea in 1990 was Dansim(the one that has a red center).
          Koreans cherish the national flower because it honors the country’s noble spirit and symbolizes the many successes as well as tribulations that the nation has experienced. Now this flower can be found as symbol in a lot of government and national organisations, decorations and badges.🇰🇷</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">Personally I love this flower and I was surprised when I found out that this was the national flower of Korea because it's a flower I have seen a lot in Serbia so I was already very familiar with it. All in all I think this flower has a beautiful meaning and hopefully some of you found out something new about Korea.💗</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Parasite</h2>
          </div>
        <p class="card-text p-4">Hi everyone, today I want ta talk a bit about one of the most famous and well done films in the last couple of years, "Parasite". 🦠🗿
          "Parasite" is a 2019 South Korean film directed by Bong Joon-ho. It's a film that follows two families, a poor family that schemes their way into becoming private workers for a very rich family who aren't aware that all of these people are related and aren't who they say they are. It's a story about the rich and the poor and it's shown through great cinematography.</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">This film was from the start very well received all over the world and it has won numerous  awards and it's biggest achievement is that it won 4 awards at the 92nd Academy Awards, making it the first non-English language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.🏆
          It's a film that was shown all over the world and you could have watched it in cinemas even in Serbia.🇷🇸
          I think that this film introduced a lot of people to Korean media and Korea in general. For me personally I loved this film, I watched it with my roommate and for the next week we talked a lot about some of the themes of the movie.</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">I think that it's best to go into this movie without knowing a lot because it's an interesting experience not knowing what are some of the genres of this film so because of that I won't talk more about some of the genius themes and their execution in the film.
          I would sincerely recommend this movie to everyone because it's literally a masterpiece of the 21. century. ❤</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Korean slang</h2>
          </div>
        <p class="card-text p-4">Hi everyone, today I want to continue my talk about the Korean language and specifically to talk a bit about Korean text slang and normal Korean slang.
          We all use some slang when texting a friend or someone close to us, for example lol or ily or nvm in English and nzm or nmg in Serbian, so it's no surprise that Koreans also have their own slang for texting. Most of it is something similar to an emoji such as ㅠㅠ which is used as a crying emoji or the words are just shortened so that it is easier and quicker to write such as  ㅎㅎ which is short for 하하(haha).📱</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">As for Korean slang that you can hear in conversations there is a lot of it. Some of the most used would be Daebak(대박) which would translate to awesome and it's used to show enthusiasm about something, another word that's frequently used is Heol(헐) which can be translated to oh my god and it's usually used to show surprise or disappointment but it's very versatile and it all depends on the situation and how you say the word.🗣
          There's a lot of Korean slang and the ones that I talked about are just some that you can see a lot on the internet or when watching kdramas or Korean shows. Hope someone learned something new today. 😄</p>

          </div>
        <p class="card-text p-4">Hi everyone! Today I want ta talk a bit about the Korean language. So the Korean language uses the Korean alphabet known as Hangul. Hangul was created by King Sejong the Great in 1443.
          It's an alphabet that's very easy to read and the modern Hangul orthography uses 24 basic letters: 14 consonant letters (ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ) and 10 vowel letters (ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ).
          You can learn to read Hangul in less then an hour if you really want to and there are a lot of tutorials online on that.</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">Today I also want ta talk a bit about some Korean common words that you can see a lot if you watch or read or generally consume any Korean media. So for example the word in the name of this project "chingu" or 친구 means friend in Korean and you can hear this word a lot if you like to watch kdramas. Or something interesting is also that there are some words that you use for different people depending on what gender you and them are and if they are younger or older than you.
          Korean is a very interesting language and also a very beautiful language that has a lot of history. In the next post I'll talk a bit more about some Korean slang so this is it for now. See you in the next post. 💙</p>

        <p class="card-text p-4">Hi everyone, today I'll be talking a little bit about Jeju Island. Jeju is the largest island in South Korea and It's located in the Jeju Province. It's a beautiful island and it's a very popular destination for a lot of Korean people who are having a vacation or honeymoon. It has a natural world heritage site, the Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes. The speciality for Jeju are tangerines, there are a lot of tangerine farms all over the island and you can see tangerines everywhere(also you can go to the farms during tangerine seasons and pick up some of them for very cheap prices).🍊</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">Since it's an island it has a lot of beautiful beaches and nice views of the sea. The island has Jeju city and a couple of museums but the beauty of the island are definitely all of the natural places such as all of the forests, hills, cliffs and valleys. So it's recommended to go hiking and go on walks all around the island.🌊🌳

          Jeju is definitely the jewel of Korea, it's the perfect destination for everyone so it's no wonder it's one of the main tourist spots in this beautiful country. 💙</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Korean BBQ</h2>
          </div>
        <p class="card-text p-4">Hi everyone! Today I want to talk about something related to the Korean culture that I really want to try and that is Korean BBQ. Korean barbecue or gogigui(in Korean) is a very popular way of grilling meat in Korea and if you ever watched a kdrama you have surely seen it. What makes it different from for example Serbian barbecue is that in the restaurants you typically have a charcoal or gas grill built into the table so that you can prepare the meat yourself also it's different because the meat is usually really thinly sliced(at least most of the cuts but not all). To me it seems like such a nice way to have a meal with your family or friends. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧👭</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">Some of the popular types of Korean barbecue include bulgogi(usually made from thinly sliced marinated beef sirloin or tenderloin) and galbi(made from marinated beef short ribs). 🍗🥩🥢
          Korean BBQ is extremely popular in Korea and has gained a lot of popularity even worldwide so if you ever have a chance to try it I really recommend it.💙</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Hanbok</h2>
          </div>
        <p class="card-text p-4">Hi everyone! So for the next couple of posts I want to talk a bit more about Korean culture. So today I want to talk about their traditional clothes, specifically the hanbok. So hanbok is a traditional Korean dress that is usualy worn for some traditional occasions such as festivals, holidays or celebrations. It's known to be a very colourful dress and usually when people talk about hanboks they mention the Joseon period. Traditional women's hanbok consists of jeogori, a blouse shirt or a jacket, and chima, a wrap-around skirt, which is usually worn full. The ensemble is often called chima jeogori. Men's hanbok consists of jeogori and loose-fitting baji ("trousers").</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">What's amazing to me is that they still wear their traditional clothes even today in these modern times and that some clothing companies have found ways to modernize it so that people can wear it with their current clothes. You can see a lot of variations of different types of modern hanboks in kpop music videos.
          But all in all I think that the hanbok is definitely a big part of Korean culture and for me it's for sure one of the thinks I would love to see and try.💙❤</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">P.S. Fun fact there is a "Hanbok Day" in Korea and it's on the 21.October 👀</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</h2>
          </div>
        <p class="card-text p-4">Hi everyone! Today I want to talk about one of my new hobbies and that is reading web novels. There is a variety of the online and you can find literally anything that you can think of and today I'll be discussing my favourite Korean web novel Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint(I know it's a hard title so from now I'll just call it ORV). 📘
          Okay so this is definitely one of the most interesting novels that I have read. It's a story full of a lot of great characters and plot twists. The thing about this novel that I think is the main reason why it was very well received in Korea is that the story is really good and you always want to know what'll happen next.
          (You can see the synopsis of this novel on the second picutre.➡️)
          This novel has been adapted into a webtoon and that's the way I found out about it.📱</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">For me it's very interesting how much I learned about Korean history by reading some of the chapters in this novel where there is talk about the wars between some of the clans on the Korean peninsula also about the wars between the Japanese and Koreans. ⚔
          I love learning new things and I have to say that I have learned a lot of new things by reading this novel and I think that is also one of the reasons why I would recommend this novel to anyone who has a bit of time and loves reading stories with a lot of action, comedy, tragedy and adventure because it's very easy to read and also very fun. 📚🌌💜

        <h2 class="card-title">Kingdom</h2>
          </div>
        <p class="card-text p-4">So since I've mostly been tallking about webtoons and I know reading isn't everyone's favourite hobby, today I want to recommend a Korean drama.
          The name of the drama is "Kingdom" and It premiered in 2019. It is a Netflix original and the main genre's are definitely horror🧟‍♀️🧟‍♂️, politics👨🏻 and history📜 since it's set during Korea's Joseon period.
          The main character is Crown Prince Lee Chang who discovers that because of certain political conspiracies a virus is spreading around the country. It's hard to describe this show in just one sentence since it's so complex and I don't want to spoil anyone who has a interest in watching this show because I think the best part of this show is that you never know what's gonna happen. The show is full of amazing characters who you either love or hate and beautifully done fight scenes and plot points that you never see coming. I would say that it's definitely one of the best dramas I have ever seen, it's very well shot and all of the actors are impressive in there own respectful roles.</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">I would recommend this drama to anyone who has liked TV shows like "Game of Thrones", "The Walking Dead" or to anyone who has a love for political and gory shows.
          You can watch both seasons of this drama on Netflix or at least check out the trailer and see if this is something that you would like because I think that this is a show that most people would enjoy.💚💛

        <h2 class="card-title">Cheese in the Trap</h2>
          </div>
        <p class="card-text p-4">So since I already talked about webtoons in general now I want to talk about one of my favourites and one of the first webtoons that I have read. The name of the webtoon is "Cheese in the Trap" by Soonkki(you can read the webtoon for free on WEBTOON either online or on the app) and it has also been adapted into a drama(2016) and a movie(2018). This webtoon is definitely the first one that I have read that wasn't a fantasy or adventure type and the most important part was that I got my first glimpse at South Korea through it.
          "Cheese in the Trap" has a really basic story centred around a girl in college but I think that one of the best parts of it is that every character is not perfect, they all have their flaws and I think that is the main part of this story that I really enjoyed and ofcourse the main characters(Hong Seol, Yoo Jung and Baek In-ho) are all really likeable in their own way. 👩🏻‍🦰👦🏻👱🏻‍♂️</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">I also really liked the drama adaptation and I would recommend it to anyone interested in more romantic and slice of life kdramas.
          All in all I would recommend this webtoon to anyone but especially to younger people and more specifically to college students because belive me you can relate to Seol a lot. 👩🏻‍🎓🧡

        <h2 class="card-title">Webtoon</h2>
          </div>
        <p class="card-text p-4">So the way I first got introduced to Korean culture was from reading webtoons. I guess the first thing I should explain is what is a webtoon? A webtoon is a sort of comic which originated from South Korea🇰🇷. What makes it unique is that it's read by scrolling down and not turning any sort of pages and the reason is because this sort of comic is meant to be read on a phone, tablet or PC. Webtoons are extremely popular in South Korea and most people read them because it's very convenient, you just take your phone, go to an app like WEBTOON or Lezhin and just find something to read. 📱</p>
        <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">I also think that by reading these comics you can find out a lot about Korea and how people there live and think. For example I found out a lot about college life in Korea by reading "Cheese in the Trap".
          There are a lot of genres but I would argue that the romance genre and the fantasy genre are the most popular. ❤🧜🏻‍♀️
          I plan on recommending some of my favourites in there own posts but here are some which have gained a lot of love from both Koreans and foreigners: Tower of God🌑(has an anime adaptation), I love Yoo💗(romance), True Beauty👩🏻 (soon it will have a kdrama adaptation), Solo Leveling🗡 (action and beautiful art), The God of Highschool 😇🐵(currently airing anime adaptation)...</p>

          <h2 class="card-title">Bukchon Hanok Village</h2>
            </div>
          <p class="card-text p-4">Bukchon Hanok Village is a traditional Korean village located in South Korea's capital Seoul. This place has a very long history and the name, that is Bukchon, translates to "northern village" and the reason for this name is because this neighborhood is located north of two important Seoul landmarks, Cheonggyecheon Stream and Jongno.</p>
          <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">In this village you can see hundreds of traditional houses(Hanok) and many beautiful old streets which have a very long history of almost 600 years. A lot of these hanoks are now small shops, cafes, guesthouses, restaurants, culure centars and even tea houses. I think that all of these places are great for people who want to learn and immerse themselves into the traditional Korean culure. I also want to point out that there are still people who live in this neighborhood so it is advised to tourists to be respectful while going throuth the streets.</p>
          <p class="card-text pl-4 pr-4">This is definitely one of the best places to visit is Seoul if zou are a lover of history. Also one more thing that is great is that it's free so you don't need to pay anything to go and visit this beautiful neighborhood. It's open for visitors everyday exept Sunday and if you want to you can get a guided tour and visit all of the interesting streets and shops that way. Either way I think this is garanteed to be a good experience for anyone who wants to see a bit of older Korean culture.</p>
